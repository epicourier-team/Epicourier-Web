# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We aim to build an open, respectful, and responsible community around **Epicourier-Web**.
Every contributor, regardless of background or role, should feel safe to share ideas, learn, and collaborate.

We use learned AI data and user information to improve our recommendation systems,
but we commit to handling all user data **securely and transparently** —
never storing or sharing it in a harmful or unauthorized way.

---

## Our Standards

We value collaboration, curiosity, and respect.
Examples of positive behavior include:

* Communicating clearly and with empathy
* Respecting different opinions and experiences
* Providing constructive feedback
* Writing code and comments that prioritize clarity, privacy, and ethics

Unacceptable behavior includes:

* Discrimination, harassment, or personal attacks
* Using or exposing user data without consent
* Introducing code that intentionally harms system stability or privacy
* Dismissing or disrespecting others’ contributions

---

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers and contributors share responsibility for keeping this community healthy.
Maintainers may remove or edit contributions that violate these standards,
and take further action if needed to ensure a safe and professional environment.

Any code or configuration that risks **user data leakage or unethical AI behavior**
will be immediately reviewed and may be reverted or rejected.

## Scope

This Code applies to all project spaces — including repositories, pull requests, discussions, and related communications.
It also applies when representing the project in public settings or external collaborations.

---

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it confidentially to:
**[epicourier.team@gmail.com](mailto:epicourier.team@gmail.com)**

Reports will be handled discreetly, and actions will be taken based on context and severity.
We are committed to fairness, transparency, and protecting the privacy of everyone involved.
